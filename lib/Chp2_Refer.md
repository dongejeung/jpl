# Chp2 Classes and Objects


- Object-oriented programming strictly separates
the notion of what is to be done from how it is done. 

- class name = type name. variable can be declared with class name.
- declare variable is only make reference.


- class's variables are called fields.
Every object has its own specific instances of these fields.
it means each object has its own unique state.

- static : one instance of a field shared by all objects of class.
=> static fields or class variables.
